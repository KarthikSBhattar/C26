C26
===

What if Dennis wrote C in 2026 instead of 1972? C26 is an experiment to answer that question without losing the low-level feel of C. Essentially its “C for 2026” with modern features and a garbage collector by default. Some code comes from an older project called JLang.

It's still heavily work in progress
- Early prototype: parser/IR still in progress.
- LOTS rough edges: crashes, missing diagnostics, and lots of TODOs.

Goals
- Be C, but garbage collected and _"modernized"_.

Contributing
------------
- Any ideas or annoyances or half-baked thoughts are VERY MUCH welcome.
